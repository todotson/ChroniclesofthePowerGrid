Follow this guide to set up Flutter with Android Studio:

https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install


I set up the Flutter and Dart SDKs in my Windows Paths. I hope that this will make the project file portable to other machines that have the SDKs set up using the Path variables as well, though I have not confirmed this. If this does not work then the SDK paths will have to be set manually in the project settings.


In order to sync the repo to your PC download the GitHub desktop app:

https://desktop.github.com/

After you log in to your GitHub account you just need to select the FREEDMGridGame repo and give it a location on your PC to sync to. Then you can simply pull the origin (GitHub's version of the repo) to your local machine. Edits to the code should be in a new branch that has been named accordingly.
